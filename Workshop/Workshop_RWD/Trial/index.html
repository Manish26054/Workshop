            <h3><u>Heading 1</u></h3>
            <p>If you place something outside of the defined grid—or due to the amount of content, more grid tracks are needed—then the grid creates rows and columns in the implicit grid. These tracks will be auto-sized by default, resulting in their size being based on the content that is inside them.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-2">
            <h3><u>Heading 2</u></h3>
            <p>When setting up an explicit grid or defining the sizing for automatically created rows or columns we may want to give tracks a minimum size, but also ensure they expand to fit any content that is added. For example, I may want my rows to never collapse smaller than 100 pixels, but if my content stretches to 300 pixels in height, then I would like the row to stretch to that height.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-3">
            <h3><u>Heading 3</u></h3>
            <p>Lines are numbered according to the writing mode of the document. In a left-to-right language, line 1 is on the left-hand side of the grid. In a right-to-left language, it is on the right-hand side of the grid. Lines can also be named, and we will look at how to do this in a later guide in this series.

            <h3><u>Line-positioning shorthands</u></h3>
            <p>
                The longhand values used above can be compressed onto one line for columns with grid-column, and one line for rows with grid-row. The following example would give the same positioning as in the previous code, but with far less CSS. The value before the forward slash character (/) is the start line, the value after the end line.
